## Homework 2

### Requirements

- Make sure that your code runs _without errors_. Solutions that throw errors will not be graded at all. Make sure that your code runs without errors in a clean session to avoid failures when your code is executed on another machine. In R-Studio open Session, select Clear Workspace. Run all your code in one go and look in the R console for errors.
- After you push a commit to github, your code will be automatically checked for errors. Go to your homework repository and open the commits view. A green tick next to your commit indicates that your code passes the tests (no errors). A red cross indicates that your code throws errors. A yellow dot means that your code is being examined (this can take some time). If you don't see a cross, a dot or a tick this means that your repository is not yet added to the automatic checking process.
- Only submit relevant code and comments. Superfluous code/comments will lead to score reduction.
- Make sure that you submit _readable_ code. Follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html). Hard to read code will lead to a score reduction. You can ignore (2.1 Object names) of the style guide.
- Before submitting, select all text in the file (in R Studio), open the Code menu and select Reformat Code.
<!-- - Do not submit code that executes install.packages. If you need to install packages, put a comment at the start of the line with install.packages before submitting. -->
- Unless explicitly required, remove lines that print objects before submitting.
